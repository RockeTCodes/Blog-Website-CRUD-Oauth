# Blog-Website-CRUD-Oauth
This is final release of this blog website with DB . It supports all the CRUD operations . I have used nodejs , express , mongoose , ejs. 
It allows users to write article , read , update and delete articles.
I have implemented google Oauth2.0 for logging in using google.


For running this locally cd into the project directory and 
"npm install" to install the dependencies .
and "nodemon" or "node app.js" to run this web app.
