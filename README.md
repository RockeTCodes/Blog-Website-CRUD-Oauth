# Blog-Website-CRUD-Oauth
This is final release of this blog website with DB . It supports all the CRUD operations . I have used nodejs , express , mongoose , ejs. 
It allows users to write article , read , update and delete articles.
I have implemented google Oauth2.0 for logging in using google.


For running this locally cd into the project directory and 
"npm install" to install the dependencies .
and "nodemon" or "node app.js" to run this web app.
Hosted on cyclic  at https://lonely-frog-dungarees.cyclic.app/

To login use https://lonely-frog-dungarees.cyclic.app/login
After logging in using google you can compose, delete or update articles.
To Compose use : - https://lonely-frog-dungarees.cyclic.app/compose
To Update use : - https://lonely-frog-dungarees.cyclic.app/update
To Delete use : - https://lonely-frog-dungarees.cyclic.app/delete

I have not added these endpoints in frontend to keep this project a little light ðŸ˜… . So you have to visit it manually.( I am Lazy )
